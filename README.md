## The Book Keeper App

>The personal digital library 

## App Philosophy

This app is inspired by [GoodReads] (https://www.goodreads.com/). As an avid reader, I often find that the most challenging part is keeping track of all of the books I've read and what my opinion was on them. Any hobbyist will enjoy discussing and tracking their progress through their pojects. With reading, it may become a challenge the more you read and the longer time passes between your favorites. 

This app aims to absolve readers of the burden of remembering all of their completed books and quickly recall their favorites to recommend and discuss with others. With this app, you can track, rate and review your in progress and completed reads. Next time someone asked what your favorite book of the year was, you can quickly recall the details and enjoy your conversation.
